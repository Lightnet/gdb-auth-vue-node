        <p>Welcome to peer to peer database decentralized prototype build. This is just a project to run some simple examples.</p>

        <ul id="example-1">
            <li v-for="item in items" :key="item.id">
                {{ item.name }}
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p> Notes: Sea.js (Security, Encryption, Authorization, Javascript) is being worked on by Amark from github as well gun.js to build database peer to peer graph engine.  </p>
